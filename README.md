# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis: 
In this challenge, we would like to use ML and Neural Networks to help Beks create a classifier that will assist in predicting if applicants will be successful if they are funded by alphabet soup. We will  be analyzing a csv file containing data from more thatn 34,000 organizations that have been funded by alphabet soup.  There is data on:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

## Results
 
### Data Preprocessing


What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
WE would look at the IS_SUCCESSFUL variable

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
EIN, NAME

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
